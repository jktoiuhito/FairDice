# FairDice

FairDice aspires to be a superior alternative to physical dice by offering extreme fairness and the capability to inspect your throw history. No more wondering if a dice is cursed, rethrowing when dice fall to the floor or trying to recall what the last throw actually was.

FairDice is a web-based app that runs in your browser, and can be used equally well in both mobile and desktop devices. Apps for Android, Linux and Windows are planned to be published in the future.

## Requirements

`node.js` is required for building the app from source.

Running the app requires any JavaScript capable browser with support for ECMAScript version 6.
